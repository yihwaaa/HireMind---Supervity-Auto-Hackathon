# 🚀 HireMind
### AI-Powered Manager Accountability & Employee Retention Intelligence

Built for the Supervity Auto Hackathon.

HireMind is an AI-powered HR Command Center that helps organizations reduce employee attrition during the critical first 90 days of employment.

Rather than focusing solely on employee performance, HireMind identifies onboarding failures, retention risks, and accountability gaps that may be caused by delayed manager actions, ignored interventions, inadequate onboarding support, or unresolved employee concerns.

By combining AI orchestration, workflow automation, and human oversight, HireMind enables HR teams to proactively intervene before retention risks become employee resignations.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Organizations invest heavily in hiring talent, yet many employees leave within their first few months.

A major challenge is that onboarding failures are often detected too late, and accountability for those failures is unclear.

Common issues include:

- Incomplete onboarding processes
- Delayed manager follow-ups
- Lack of employee support
- Unresolved concerns and workplace issues
- Missing ownership of onboarding outcomes
- Poor visibility into retention risks

Without clear accountability, employee experience deteriorates and the likelihood of attrition increases.

---

# 💡 Solution

HireMind provides AI-powered monitoring and analysis across the employee onboarding journey.

The platform continuously evaluates:

- Employee onboarding progress
- Provisioning readiness
- Employee engagement and sentiment
- Confidential employee concerns
- Retention risk indicators
- Manager accountability

When risks are detected, HireMind automatically:

- Identifies root causes
- Highlights accountability gaps
- Generates intervention plans
- Escalates critical cases to HR
- Produces executive retention briefings

---

# ⭐ Core Innovation: Manager Accountability

The Manager Accountability Operator is the key differentiator of HireMind.

Instead of only assessing employee performance, it evaluates whether managers are actively supporting onboarding success.

The operator identifies:

- Ignored intervention recommendations
- Overdue management actions
- Escalated issues without follow-up
- Lack of onboarding support
- Accountability gaps contributing to retention risk

When accountability issues are detected, HireMind can:

- Flag the responsible manager
- Recommend corrective actions
- Escalate cases to HR leadership
- Provide accountability insights for decision-making

# 🚀 AutoPilot Template

Your AI Command Center starter kit for the AutoPilot Hackathon.

Build an intelligent, multi-agent command center that automates business processes with AI — while keeping humans in the loop for oversight and exception handling.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have these installed on your machine:

| Tool | macOS | Windows | Why you need it |
|------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **Docker Desktop** | [Download for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) | [Download for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) | Runs all services (backend, frontend, database) in containers |
| **Git** | Pre-installed or `brew install git` | [Download](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or `winget install Git.Git` | Clone the repository |

> **Windows users:** Make sure WSL 2 is enabled (Docker Desktop will prompt you). If you see a WSL error, run `wsl --install` in PowerShell as Administrator and restart.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started — Step by Step

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

**macOS (Terminal) / Windows (PowerShell / Git Bash):**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd AutoPilot-Template
```

### Step 2: Create Your Environment File

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
copy .env.example .env
```

> The default `.env` works out of the box — `AUTH_BYPASS=true` means no external auth setup needed. The app starts with a "Dev User" session automatically.

### Step 3: Start Docker Desktop

1. Open **Docker Desktop** from your Applications (Mac) or Start Menu (Windows)
2. Wait until the Docker icon in your system tray/menu bar shows **"Docker Desktop is running"**
3. If this is your first time, Docker may take 1-2 minutes to initialize

### Step 4: Start All Services

**macOS / Linux (Terminal):**
```bash
make up
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\scripts\start.ps1
```

> This script clears WSL2 port conflicts, starts Docker, and verifies all services are reachable.
> You can still use `docker compose up --build -d` directly, but the script handles a common Windows networking issue automatically.

> First run takes 2-5 minutes to download images and build containers. Subsequent runs use cache and start in ~15 seconds.

### Step 5: Verify Everything is Running

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
docker compose ps
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
docker compose ps
```

You should see 3 services with status `running` or `Up`:
```
NAME                              STATUS
autopilot-template-postgres-1     running (healthy)
autopilot-template-backend-1      running
autopilot-template-frontend-1     running
```

### Step 6: Open Your Command Center

| Service | URL | What it is |
|---------|-----|------------|
| 🖥️ **Dashboard** | [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) | Your Command Center UI |
| ⚙️ **API Docs** | [http://localhost:8001/api/docs](http://localhost:8001/api/docs) | Backend Swagger documentation |
| 🗄️ **Database** | `localhost:5432` | PostgreSQL (user: `user`, password: `password`) |

**You should see the Command Center dashboard with:**
- Stat cards showing AI activity metrics
- An activity chart with weekly data
- An AI Confidence indicator
- The AI Manager button in the top header bar

---

## 🛑 Stopping & Restarting

### Stop All Services

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
make down
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
docker compose down
```

### Restart (without rebuilding)

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
docker compose up -d
```

### Full Rebuild (after code changes)

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
make up
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Clean Reset (fresh start — removes all data)

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
make down
docker volume rm autopilot-template_postgres_data autopilot-template_document_storage
make up
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
docker compose down
docker volume rm autopilot-template_postgres_data autopilot-template_document_storage
docker compose up --build -d
```

## 🔍 Viewing Logs & Debugging

### Watch all logs at once
```bash
# macOS / Linux
docker compose logs -f

# Stop following with Ctrl+C
```

### Watch a specific service
```bash
# Backend only
docker compose logs -f backend

# Frontend only
docker compose logs -f frontend

# Database only
docker compose logs -f postgres
```

### Check if a service is healthy
```bash
# Quick health check
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health

# Or check container status
docker compose ps
```

### Restart a single service (without touching others)
```bash
docker compose restart frontend
docker compose restart backend
```

## Key Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AUTH_BYPASS` | `true` | Skip all auth (dev mode) |
| `AUTH_DEBUG` | `true` | Verbose auth logging |
| `APP_ENV` | `development` | Backend mode |
| `DATABASE_URL` | auto-generated | PostgreSQL connection |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | `http://localhost:3001` | CORS origin |

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Docker not found** | Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and make sure it's running |
| **Port 3001 already in use** | Stop whatever is on that port: `lsof -ti:3001 \| xargs kill` (Mac) or change the port in `docker-compose.yml` |
| **Port 5432 already in use** | You have a local PostgreSQL running. Stop it or change the port in `docker-compose.yml` |
| **`make` not found (Windows)** | Use `docker compose` commands directly (see table above) or install make via `choco install make` |
| **WSL error (Windows)** | Run `wsl --install` in PowerShell as Admin, then restart your PC |
| **ERR_CONNECTION_RESET on localhost (Windows)** | WSL2's relay can intercept port 3001 via IPv6. Use `.\scripts\start.ps1` which handles this automatically, or manually run `wsl --shutdown` before `docker compose up --build -d`. |
| **Containers crash-looping** | Check logs: `docker compose logs backend` — usually a missing env var or DB issue |
| **Frontend shows blank page** | Check if backend is healthy: `curl http://localhost:8001/api/health` |
| **Database connection refused** | Wait 10-15 seconds after startup — Postgres needs time to initialize on first run |
